<b><h1>Responsive Postcard Feedback</h1></b>

    <ol type="1">
    <li>I think that the font family should be more considered. The font right now does not seem very engaging and does not serve to create an aesthetic.</li><br> 
    <li>The font color of the second set of images can be white. Black looks weird against the blue background.</li><br>
    <li>The font size should be larger and should also change size when the screen size changes.</li><br>
    <li>The second picture with Jack Dawson optimized for a phone screen seems as if the image is not tall enough and it cut off at the top.</li><br>
    <li>I think that you can also stand to incorporate gradients in the background to make your images look more crisp and fresh.</li><br>
    <li>If you can make your images higher resolution that would be better.</li><br>
    <li>Make your designs more lively overall.</li><br>
