	1. My name is Patrick Zhou. I am a current sophomore studying Communications Design, Supply Chain Management, minoring in East Asian Studies.<br><br>

	2. I am from Cupertino, CA. Upon reflection, I am very lucky to have grown up in such a nice place. I have artistic and design background and this is what primarily prompted me to take this course. This course is required for me to get a Communication Design degree, but more importantly, I will learn critical skills from this class that will help me in my design work in the future and also hopefully help me land a job back in the Bay Area. Knowing a little computer science is important for my design work and also widely utilized in the Bay Area. <br><br>

	3. I do not have experience in CSS or HTML. This is my first time.<br><br>

	4. I hope that I would be able to learn sufficient coding and be able to use HTML and CSS fluently. With these skills, I can hopefully be able to design a holistic website or web pages.<br><br> 

	5. The biggest difference that I can imagine is that I can't just draw what I want wherever. In order to place some design element or function in a website I would have to code it. For example, if I want to center something in drawing all I need to do is simply draw the object in the center. Using the computer I would have to take the extra step of coding it on the computer. It feels very much like designing via a remote rather than with my own hands.<br><br>

	6. I think that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/muslims-camps-china/</">Reuters</a> exemplifies effective design. The layout of its website is extremely clean and easy to navigate. I especially enjoy these graphic articles that Reuters publishes. The graphics are aesthetically pleasing and the natural flow of the articles are intuitive.<br><br>

	7. I think that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>   exemplifies effective communication. The website lists trending topics on the internet based on upvotes and downvotes. It is extremely simple to glance what each post is about. A user can get a lot of information on the front page of Reddit and decide which post he or she wants to interact with.<br><br>

	8. I really like <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/">Volvo's Website</a> because it is extremely easy to navigate and clean. It is user friendly and you do not have to search hard to find what you want.
