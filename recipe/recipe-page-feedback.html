	<ol type="1">
	<li>Use more variation in text and change it up. For example, in the small prep time section, can add bodl or something else rather than have them just all be italic to introduce visual interest.</li><br>
	<li>Use more of the h1 font throughout the recipe, not just only on the title and the end.</li><br>
	<li>Try to keep the margins consistent. Image and text should align. Maybe make the margins wider for the text</li><br>
	<li>Reconsider the margins and white spaces throughout your recipe page.</li><br>
	<li>The italics are a little hard to read.</li><br>
	<li>Maybe number the steps for the instructions?</li><br>
	</ol>
