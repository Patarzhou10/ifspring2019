		<h1>Party in the U.S.A (2009)</h1><b>

<div class="a">
<p>[Verse 1]<br>
I hopped off the plane at LAX<br>
With a dream and my cardigan<br>
Welcome to the land of fame excess,<br>
Whoa, am I gonna fit in?<br>
Jumped in the cab,<br>
Here I am for the first time<br>
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign<br>
This is all so crazy<br>
Everybody seems so famous<br><br>

[Pre-Chorus 1]<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous,<br>
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio<br>
And the Jay Z song was on<br>
And the Jay Z song was on<br>
And the Jay Z song was on<br><Br>

[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song,<br>
And the butterflies fly away<br>
Noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up,<br>
They're playin' my song<br>
You know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br>
Yeah it's a party in the USA<br><br>

[Verse 2]<br>
Get to the club in a taxi cab<br>
Everybody's looking at me now<br>
Like "who's that chick, that's rockin' kicks?<br>
She's gotta be from out of town"<br>
So hard with my girls not around me<br>
Its definitely not a Nashville party<br>
Cause' all I see are stilettos<br>
I guess I never got the memo<br><br>

[Pre-Chorus 2]<br>
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda home sick<br>
Too much pressure and I'm nervous<br>
That's when the D.J. dropped my favorite tune<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br>
And a Britney song was on<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song,<br>
And the butterflies fly away<br>
Noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up,<br>
They're playin' my song<br>
You know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br>
Yeah it's a party in the USA<br><br>

[Bridge]<br>
Feel like hoppin' on a flight (On a flight)<br>
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)<br>
But something stops me every time (Every time)<br>
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song,<br>
And the butterflies fly away<br>
Noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up,<br>
They're playin' my song<br>
You know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br>
Yeah it's a party in the USA<br><br>

[Chorus]<br>
So I put my hands up<br>
They're playing my song,<br>
And the butterflies fly away<br>
Noddin' my head like, yeah<br>
Movin' my hips like, yeah<br>
I got my hands up,<br>
They're playin' my song<br>
You know I'm gonna be okay<br>
Yeah, it's a party in the USA<br>
Yeah it's a party in the USA<br>
